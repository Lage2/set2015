						Hugo believes he’s one of the few lucky people that can say he worked very few days in his life... not because of lack of a job (fortunately), but because when you do stuff you love and you're passionate about almost every single day, there's no boundary between what's work and what's just pure fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						He completed his MSc degree in Electrical and Computers Engineering in 2007 from the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), University of Lisbon (UL), and since 2004, Hugo is a researcher at the IT - Instituto de Telecomunicações (http://www.it.pt/person_detail_p.asp?id=1293), where he’s currently pursuing his PhD. In 2012 he was a visiting researcher at the Computational and NeuroEgineering Labority (CNEL) from the University of Florida.
					</p>
					<p>
						He is also one of the co-founders of PLUX – Wireless Biosignals (http://www.plux.info), established in 2007 as an innovative technology-based company operating in the field of medical devices for healthcare and quality of life, where Hugo is currently a Board Member and Innovation Advisor.
					</p>
					<p>
						More recently, he has been actively working (i.e. having fun) towards making the world a bit more physiological, through BITalino (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitalino/bitalino-revolution), an open source software and low-cost hardware toolkit, that allows anyone from students to professional app developers, to create cool projects and applications with physiological sensors.
					</p>
					<p>
						His main interest areas include biosignal research, system engineering, signal processing, and pattern recognition, and his work has been distinguished with several academic and technical awards such as the "Most Innovative Technology" award at the MIT Portugal E3 Forum, the selection as a semi-finalist to the Engadget Expand NY Inset Coin competition in 2013, the Life Sciences Award in 2010 at a venture competition co-promoted by the MIT, and the "Caixa Geral de Depósitos Award" from 2003 to 2005 for recognized academic merit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hugo is an IEEE Student Member since 2010, affiliated with the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, and an active member of the IEEE EMBS Student Chapter at the IST/UL.
